# Shopify Event Processor

## The Need

When building Shopify applications, you need to respond to real-time events happening in your connected stores - new products being created, orders being placed, customers signing up, and more. However, handling these webhook events at scale presents several challenges:

- **Event Processing**: Need to reliably process webhook events from multiple stores
- **Token Management**: Must securely retrieve and use access tokens for each store
- **Scalability**: Handle varying loads of webhook events efficiently
- **Reliability**: Ensure webhook events are processed even during high traffic
- **Monitoring**: Track and log all webhook processing for debugging and analytics

## The Solution

The Shopify Event Processor is a focused, serverless microservice that solves these challenges by:

- **Centralized Processing**: Single service dedicated to webhook event processing
- **Microservices Architecture**: Integrates with `shopify-auth-service` for secure token retrieval
- **Serverless Scaling**: Automatically scales with AWS Lambda based on webhook volume
- **Event-Driven Design**: Processes events asynchronously with proper error handling
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Backend Sync Middleware**: Perfect for syncing Shopify data to custom backends and databases

This service is part of a microservices architecture where it retrieves access tokens from the `shopify-auth-service` and processes webhook events from Shopify stores.

## Use Cases

### 1. Custom Backend Synchronization
Use this service as middleware to keep your custom backend in sync with Shopify:

- **Product Catalog Sync**: Automatically update your database when products are created/updated
- **Order Management**: Sync orders to your custom order management system
- **Customer Data**: Keep customer information synchronized across systems
- **Inventory Management**: Update stock levels in real-time

### 2. Data Pipeline Integration
Process webhook events and forward them to other systems:

- **Analytics Platforms**: Send events to data warehouses or analytics tools
- **CRM Integration**: Sync customer data with Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.
- **Marketing Automation**: Trigger campaigns based on customer actions
- **Third-party APIs**: Forward events to external services and APIs

## Features

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
# Shopify Configuration
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_shopify_client_id
SHOPIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_shopify_client_secret
SHOPIFY_API_VERSION=2025-07
SHOPIFY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret_here

# AWS Configuration
AWS_DYNAMODB_TABLE=portfolio-shopify-auth
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key

# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 22+
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
npm install
```

### Local Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

The service will start on port 3001 by default. For serverless offline development:

```bash
npm run offline
```

This starts the service using serverless-offline for local testing with AWS Lambda simulation.

### Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy
```

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
```
GET /health
```

### Webhook Processing
```
POST /webhooks/{topic}/{action}
```

Where `{topic}` and `{action}` form the webhook topic (e.g., `products/create`, `orders/paid`).

### Webhook Management API
```
GET /api/webhooks/list?shop={shop_domain}
POST /api/webhooks/register
GET /api/webhooks/{webhook_id}
DELETE /api/webhooks/{webhook_id}
```

These endpoints allow you to manage webhooks programmatically using the stored access tokens.

## Microservices Architecture

This service is designed to work with the `shopify-auth-service`:

1. **shopify-auth-service**: Handles OAuth flow and stores encrypted access tokens in DynamoDB
2. **shopify-event-processor**: Retrieves tokens from DynamoDB and processes webhook events

### Webhook Configuration

You can configure webhooks in two ways:

#### Option 1: Shopify Partners Dashboard
1. Go to your app in the Partners dashboard
2. Navigate to App setup > Webhooks
3. Add webhook subscriptions pointing to your deployed endpoint:
   - URL: `https://your-api-gateway-url/webhooks/{topic}/{action}`
   - Format: JSON
   - API version: 2025-07 (or your preferred version)

#### Option 2: Programmatic Registration (Recommended)
Use the webhook management API to register webhooks programmatically:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://your-api-gateway-url/api/webhooks/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "shop": "your-shop.myshopify.com",
    "topic": "products/create",
    "address": "https://your-api-gateway-url/webhooks/products/create"
  }'
```

## Architecture

The service is built with a modular architecture:

- **Middleware**: HMAC verification, raw body capture, event logging
- **Handlers**: Event-specific processing logic for different webhook topics
- **Services**: Token management, webhook management, and DynamoDB integration
- **Types**: TypeScript definitions for webhook data and API responses
- **Routes**: Express.js routing for webhook endpoints and management API

## Extending the Service

To add support for new webhook topics:

1. Add the topic to `WEBHOOK_TOPICS` in `src/webhooks/types/index.ts`
2. Create a new handler class extending `BaseWebhookHandler` in `src/webhooks/services/index.ts`
3. Register the handler in `WebhookHandlerRegistry`
4. Implement the specific event processing logic

### Example: Adding a new webhook handler

```typescript
export class CustomWebhookHandler extends BaseWebhookHandler {
  async handle(data: any, req: WebhookRequest): Promise<WebhookHandlerResult> {
    const topic = req.webhookTopic || 'unknown';
    const shop = req.webhookShop || 'unknown';
    
    this.logEvent(topic, shop, data);
    
    // Your custom processing logic here
    
    return {
      success: true,
      message: 'Custom webhook processed successfully',
      data: { /* your response data */ }
    };
  }
}
```

### Example: Backend Synchronization Handler

Here's a practical example of how to sync product data to your custom backend:

```typescript
export class ProductSyncHandler extends BaseWebhookHandler {
  async handle(data: any, req: WebhookRequest): Promise<WebhookHandlerResult> {
    const topic = req.webhookTopic || 'unknown';
    const shop = req.webhookShop || 'unknown';
    
    this.logEvent(topic, shop, data);
    
    try {
      switch (topic) {
        case 'products/create':
          await this.syncProductToBackend(data, shop, 'create');
          break;
        case 'products/update':
          await this.syncProductToBackend(data, shop, 'update');
          break;
        case 'products/delete':
          await this.deleteProductFromBackend(data.id, shop);
          break;
      }
      
      return {
        success: true,
        message: `Product ${topic} synced to backend successfully`,
        data: { productId: data.id, action: topic }
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Backend sync failed:', error);
      return {
        success: false,
        message: 'Failed to sync product to backend',
        data: { error: error.message }
      };
    }
  }
  
  private async syncProductToBackend(productData: any, shop: string, action: string) {
    // Example: Sync to your custom database
    const product = {
      shopifyId: productData.id,
      shop: shop,
      title: productData.title,
      handle: productData.handle,
      vendor: productData.vendor,
      price: productData.variants?.[0]?.price,
      inventory: productData.variants?.[0]?.inventory_quantity,
      syncedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      action: action
    };
    
    // Insert/update in your database
    await this.database.products.upsert(product);
    
    // Optional: Send to other systems
    await this.notifyOtherSystems(product);
  }
  
  private async deleteProductFromBackend(productId: number, shop: string) {
    await this.database.products.delete({ shopifyId: productId, shop });
  }
  
  private async notifyOtherSystems(product: any) {
    // Send to analytics, CRM, marketing tools, etc.
    await Promise.all([
      this.sendToAnalytics(product),
      this.updateSearchIndex(product),
      this.notifyInventorySystem(product)
    ]);
  }
}
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

### Testing Webhooks Locally

You can test webhook processing locally using serverless offline:

```bash
npm run offline
```

Then test with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3001/webhooks/products/create" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": 123, "title": "Test Product", "handle": "test-product"}'
```
